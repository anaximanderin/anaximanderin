### 🧪 About Me

- 🛠️ Building weird and (sometimes) useful things on EVM compatible chains
- 🔐 Focused on smart contracts, dApps, and trustless systems
- 🧠 Currently deep-diving into L2s, zk-rollups, and whether or not any of this is real
- 🧘 Trying to keep my code cleaner than my commit history

---

### 🚀 Current Projects

- 🧱 **Some DApp** – Making buttons do blockchain stuff  
- 🔄 **Gas-Optimized Smart Contracts** – Because every `wei` counts  
- 📦 **Open Source Toys** – I break things so you don’t have to

### 🤓 Fun Facts

- `abc.xyz` was *this* close… until Google outbid me by a few trillion.
- My smart contracts compile on the first try 100% of the time — after the 37th attempt.
- Deploying dApps just to test how broken they can get in production.
